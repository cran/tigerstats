#' Labels and Perception of Quality
#' 
#' Students in MAT 111 performed an experiment to see whether the perception of
#' the quality of peanut butter was affected by the labeling on the peanut
#' butter jar.  Each subject tasted from two jars, one of which was labeled
#' Jiff, and the other of which was labeled Great Value (a cheaper brand).
#' Unknown to the subjects, both jars contained Great Value peanut butter.
#' Each subject rated the quality of the peanut butter on a scale of 1 to 10.
